Word Typer is a program to practice your typing skills.
This program is coded in C++ and uses the FLTK GUI tool kit.

My goal for the finished version of this program is to allow the user to
choose their own text to practice typing. The user will be able to do
this by selecting a text file and importing it into the program.
